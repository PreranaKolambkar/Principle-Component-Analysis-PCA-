# Principle-Component-Analysis-PCA-
This project applies PCA for dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to analyze data. It explores the dataset using EDA, then reduces its complexity with PCA before clustering the data. The results are compared to evaluate how PCA affects clustering performance and insights are provided for better data analysis.
